;;; What is this talk of 'release'? Klingons do not make software
;;; 'releases'.  Our software 'escapes', leaving a bloody trail of
;;; designers and quality assurance people in its wake.

;;; Somewhere, we need to include some helper functions which allow us
;;; to convert between lists and vectors, and between lists of lists
;;; and matrices.  This is the only point of this file's functions.

;;; While any sensible lisp programmer would savor the API, IÂ´m
;;; corrupting it in favor of getting-stuff-done.
